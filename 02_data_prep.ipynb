    "# MLOps for RSEs - 2. Data Preparation and Exploration\n",
    "\n",
    "The first part of a machine learning project is to producer a dataset that can be used to train and optimise one or more machine learning models. In many ways this part is the most familiar for RSEs as dataset are gathered and processed routinely for almost all research projects rather than being a particular requirement for ML projects. There are some challenges in creating a *good* dataset for use in an ML project. This notebook will look at what the requirements for the data pipeline are that RSEs will need to support and some tools and practices that can make this process easier. \n",

    "\n",
    "Exactly what a data preparation pipeline will look like is of course very problem and domain dependant. Of all the parts of a machine learning project, this is the part that is most likely to include \"domain specific\" tools, that is tools that are specific to the particular area of research covered by the project, rather than generic data science or machine learning tools that will be used in most of the rest of an ML project. The key parts of a pipeline include:\n",

    "* Data Gathering - The first step is to get the data together that will be used to create the final output. The data might be coming from public datasets, generated by a simulation, gathered from observation (either by you or some one else), scraped from the web or many other possible locations. Many ML projects involve combining data from different sources. Some times the data are easy to use together, other times a lot of subsequent processing will be required for the data to be *analysis-ready*, or more specifically *machine learning-ready*.\n",
    "  * Distributed processing - In some cases you may like to do some of the subsequent processing steps in a distributed fashion wherever the data is located rather than first gathering the data in a singhle location, particular where the processing involves subsetting and reduction that result in a much smaller output than input. Generally data transfer is expensive, so a good practice is to *take the compute to the data*. For example if data is located on a particular server and you need to extract data for a particular temporal and spatial location, it would be prereable to do that on the server if possible and then only copy accross the data to be used to the central processing location for the project.\n",
    "* Cleaning - Removing bad data or infilling missing data. Homogenising representations of data e.g. names of categories.\n",
    "* Subsetting - Select the subset of interest for training your machine learning model.\n",
    "* Transformation - Change the representation of your data to be consistent across data sources e.g. representing geospatial data on the same projection and grid.\n",
    "* Calculation of derived fields - A feature that combines various fields from raw data may be a better predictor, so such fields are typically calculated as part of the data preparation.\n",
    "* Merging - Many machine learning projects bring together data from several sources which once the previous steps have been performed are merged into a single coherent dataset.\n",
    "* Storing - Once the dataset has been created, it needs to be stored somewhere for reuse, ideally accordinging to FAIR principles and somewhere access if efficient.\n",
    "* Cataloging and Documenting - Add your dataset to a catalog or other collection of datasets to enable to eassily find and (re)use it.\n",

    "\n",
    "The first dataset we will explore comes from a challenge by a Met Office Chief Operational Meteorologist. In certain locations around the world turbulent lee wave gusts called *rotors* can cause problems for aviation. These are localised topographically-driven turbulent wind gusts and where these occur at an airfiel make conditions siufficiently hazardous so as to cause operations to be suspended. Rotors therefore impact the aviation industry, in partticular where flights have to be diverted  for considerable distances from isolated airfields.  \n",
    "\n",
    "What is needed is a prediction of whether such rotors are likely in a given time window, so that flight can be postponed or cancelled rather than risking the flight and turning back wasting fuel. As these are small scale features, they are not explicitly resolved in coarse resolution global models. Human OpMets are able to look at this model data and \n",
    " determine whether rotors are likely, but this is error-prone and time consuming. Can we train a machine learning algorithm to act as a tool to help OpMets with this process and provide a second opinion. In particular, a machine learning solution can easily look at multiple model outputs (ensemble output, different forecast centres e.g. ECMWF).\n",

    "\n",
    "We will start. by exploring the wind rotors data set, and cleaning and prearing the data for machine learning as described above. First we will load in the \"raw\" dataset into a data frame. In this particular instance we won't use the standard library for dataframe *pandas*, instead wel will the dataframe implementation supplied dask. This support *lazy loading* natively, so instead of loading our dataset that may be too large to fit in memory, or may just require waiting a long time for it to load, it reads only the *metadata* which tells it enough to construct a stub data strcuture and plan the computations. Any subsequent calculation will similarly not actually be executed when called, but rather continue the *lazy execution* paradigm. This creates a *task graph* whivch represents the chain of tasks in our workflow. \n",
    "\n",
    "When we have constrcuted the graph representing the workflow, we can then trigger executiomn of all the steps. An additional advantage is that we can send the workflow to another, potentially shared remote, platform from our interactive compute (eg. local laptop, notebooks server) which may have more substantial resources (more memory, many CPUs, specialised processors like GPUs)."

    "### Create an interactive dashboard for data exploration\n",
    "Part of the initial process of a machine learning project is to explore the contents of the dataset, especially where it is unfamiliar to those researcvhers working with it. You may wish to get a sense of the values,s trcutures and relationships in the data. Thyere are a variety of ways to do this, through visualising the \"raw\" data directly, or summary statitics and derived metrics and indices which describe the data Often it will be helpful to be able to share both the results of the *exploratory data analysis* and access to exploratory code itself. This can be done without having to run code directly by quickly creating a *dashboard* use one of the many python, R, javascript or other langiuage tools to do this. This allows a range of experts in different areas to explore the data to inform subsequent data analysis and modelling choices use in the machine learning pipeline.\n",

    "Our next example further explores processing at scale on a different sort of data often called *gridded data* in environmental science. This is essentially data that has a similar strcutre to image or more generally *raster* data. The difference here is that our grid may extend in n dimensions, such as latitude, longitude, height above the surface, time, ensemble realisation etc. Here we use the ERA5 reanlsysis dataset to create \"weather regime clusters\", that is find groups of air pressure patterns that are similar and are likely to be associated with similar sorts of weather. One could use experts to describe what they think such patterns would be, or one can use a data driven approach like clustering to find what patterns are actually present in the data and may reveal paterns that had not been previously considered.\n",

    "The particular challenges in this problem are again around the scale of the data requiring processing, but also around the use of doamin specifc libraries for processing. We will often need to use various domain specific tools and techniques in the data preparation part of the pipeline to prepare the data for use with more generic machine learning and data science tools. In this example we are using the Met Office python library [Iris](https://scitools-iris.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), which handles gridded meteorological (i.e. climate and weather) data and metadata and includes various meteorology specific functionality and handles specific data storage formats such as *NetCDF* and *Grib2*.

    "When you think of a dataset, you probably think of a series of files in some format (often NetCDF files for weather and climate data, maybe [FITS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FITS) in astronomy or [BAM files](https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/SAMv1.pdf) in genetics. Researchers in general don't care about the files themselves, but rather getting the data they contained loaded in memeory. There are now better options for presenting data than just a unorder collection of files. One such option is a *catalog*. The idea here is the curated data files files are presented logically in terms of the different datasets, which each logical dataset presented as a single object, irrespective of how the data is actally stored on disk. There could be one file or many files, or it could be coming from a database or an API, the researcher sees a dataset, which can then be requested and loaded into memory (either actually loading the data or setting up a stub for subsequent lazy loading and loazy execution).\n",

    "* Data Driver - A script which knows how to load the data in questin and return an in memory data object. This is generally provided for many existing popular data formats. It is also fairly easy to write one's own driver for new data formats (for example environmental data formats are well supported, but perhaps medical data formats are less well supported). "

We have used these tools in quite basic way, there are many more advanced options and tools that implement the same principles. Similarly there examples are very weather and climate focused as well as python centric. Different tools or languages will be used for different research areas (e.g. R and R Shiny may be popular)\n",
