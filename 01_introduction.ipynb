    "## What is an RSE?\n",
    "\n",
    "Before start considering what we mean by ML Ops, lets first remind ourselves (or maybe clearly define for thos who are new to the field) exactly what we mean by a Research Software Engineer or RSE. The reason for doing this is it will help us define what the tasks and responsibilities of an RSE is in a machine learning project compared to the responsilibities of the researchers themselves. A good place to start is the definition of an RSE from the RSE association site:\n",
    "\n",
    "*A Research Software Engineer works with researchers to gain an understanding of the problems they face, then develops, maintains and extends software to provide the answers*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Often the researchers themselves will do this to a certain extent as well and there exists a continuim from reseasercher to software engineer along which an RSE falls, so some questions are usually helpful in determining if you, so there are some helpful questions to ask to determibne if you are an RSE, such as\n",
    "* employed to develop software for research\n",
    "* spend more time developing software than doing research\n",
    "* you develop software that underpins the published research of others, rather than mainly publishing papers youerself\n",
    "\n",
    "The above definition doesn't capture though (in my opnio) the key areas where RSEs add value and where a project is more efficient by having an RSE supporting it even if the reseasrchers themselves areall very capable programmers and conforatable with IT infrastrcuture. The key purpose/role of of RSEs on a project and where they add value are:\n",
    "* Provide solid technical foundation for research work (scalable, reliable, reusable)\n",
    "* Ensure research software assets are FAIR\n",
    "* Provide the technical uderpinnings for reproducible research \n"

    "### RSE Perspective\n",
    "\n",
    "Why might an RSE care about adopting MLOps or DevOps  practices? Many RSEs are already doing this, even if they do not realise it, as often with research software the same person or small group of people is responsible for both developing and supporting a software package or library. Applying principles like automation and continuous improvement can reduce the burden of supporting the software and make it easier to respond to requests from researchers for new features, extensions and improvements. \n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, machine learning is still relatively new to many researchers, and so good practices for using machine learning in reseasrch projects are not widely known and understood. Often these practices are no different to those for other research software, but the tendency to see machine learning as something new and exotic and somehow funamentally different (phrases like the AI revolution or the fourth industrial revolution are often unhelpful and counter-productive in such a context), lead to even existing well-known practices not being used because it thought they are irrelevant or obsolete. \n",
    "\n",
    "So there is both a substantial challenge and an exciting as more and more research projects incorporate machine learning as one of the key research tools opprtunity for RSEs to make research that depends on ML both better and easier through the use of MLOps primnciples and practices applied to research software.\n"

    "### Machine Learning Pipeline\n",
    "We'll start by looking at the overall parts of a machine learning pipeline that oen may build for a reseasrch project. Below is a list (more or less in the order of execution in a data pipeline), of the minimum generic components required for a well executed\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Data Loading & Cleaning* - Start by loading the data, and filtering out any data considered to be unsuitable training and evaluation of machine learning algorithms. Selection of appropriate data is an important way in which domain expertise in vital in getting good results.\n",
    "* *Feauture Engineering* - The first step is to prepare the data for presenting to the algorithm. Different ways of presenting the data will emphasise different features, and choosing the right features is important for getting good results. Knowledge of what features represent based on domain knowledge is again very important.\n",
    "* *Train/test Split* - Before we train the algorithm, we need to split into train and test sets. This is to ensure out algorithm doesn't overfit, learning irrelevant details that are not representative of the whole space of possible data, but rather that in generalises well.\n",
    "* *Data Preparation* - The machine learning algorithm only sees numbers as numbers, with no inherent understnading oif meaning or context. We need to ensure different features are scaled to be comparable, otherwise big numbers will be treated as more important by the algorithm, irrespective of what those numbers mean. Value are typically scaled to a range of [0,1] or, assuming a gaussian distribution, to have mean=0 and std_dev=1.\n",
    "* *Algorithm Setup* - Here we select the particular algorithm e,.g. neural network, k-means clustering, and specify the hyperparameters. It is important to distinguish between parameters and hyperparameters.\n",
    "  * Parameters are the values that calculated by the training process.\n",
    "  * Hyperparameters are values specified in algorithm setup, which are not altered by training. These need to be fine-tuned using an additional outer training loop called hyperparameter tuning.\n",
    "* *Algorithm Training* - Execute the algorithm to calculate the best parameters for the chosen ML algorithm to fit the supplied training data\n",
    "* *Inference* - Once we have an algorithm, we use it to produce predictions, for both the train and test sets.\n",
    "* *Evaluation* - We then compare the predictions of the trained algorithms to expected results. For supervised learning, this will be supplied target values. For unsupervised learning, we will expplore the results and their usefulness much like in exploratory data analysis.\n",
    "* *Interpretability & Explainability* - Explaining how the model produced a certain prediction ( looking inside the blackbox) and interpreting what the prediction means in terms of relation to the real world problem.\n",
    "* *Model Storage* - Model training can be an expensive process that we don't want to perform too often, and. once we have a model that performs well we save its state so it can be reloaded and used subsequently for inference on later problems."

    "Next to consider is where and how an RSE could or should get involved in the development and deployment of such a workflow.  In reseasrch projects projects generally occupy the  Prototype phase of the ML Life cycle diagram, with the other parts generally happening when a project is taken on by another organisation to be commercialised or generally turned into a product of some part. So in this tutorial we are focusing on the elements of the pipeline in the prootype phase. The focus of RSE invlvement in a project can generally be divided ionto three phases, each incorporating mutlple elements of the ML workflow described above. This will form the strcuture for the remainder of this tutorial: \n",
    "* *Data Preparation and Exploration*  - Finding and aggregating data into a coherent dataset and transforming it into an analysis ready dataset for researchers to use as input to a machine learning pipeline.\n",
    "* *Model Development* Set up the tools and infrastrcuture required to train large macine learning models and keep track of the input and outputs.\n",
    "* *Model Evaluation (\"Evaluate models\")* - Evaluate the performance of the trained models in terms of accuracy metrics, explainability/interpretability metrics and enable sharing of models and predictions.\n",

    "In many ways developing software for a machine learning project is no different than for any other sort of software project, but there are some additional or different challenges and also some different tools to supports tasks that are unique to a machine learning pipeline. In order to apply the principles of good software development that are typically applied by RSEs to ML projects RSEs will need to know about what ML software development and support has in common with other sorts of projects and what is different, and what tools are needed to suopport the different aspects. Many of these tools are about promoting these good practices in research ML projects, where researchers may not not be familiar with those good practicves or have the technical knowledge to set up and use the infrastructure tand tools to implement those practices. These notebooks will demonstrate some of tose tools that promote good practices leading to reproducible, scalable research software.\n"
